        See the interaction_picture function for more background
        J represents the number of atoms
        In this article there are three additional sources of error
            - the precision on preparing the amplitudes sqrt(zeta_l), eps_mu
            - the precision on the position of the atomic nuclei, 1/delta_R. In the article we take log(1/delta_R) < 1/3 log(N)
            - The precision due to the finite value of M_0 = eta N t / eps_M_0
            
        The algorithm follows a very similar structure to that of the interaction_picture one.
